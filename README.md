This is an bash wrapper for [changelog-generator](https://github.com/lob/generate-changelog), to automatic create, commit, push, an CHANGELOG.md from your git repo commits.

## Why?
---
During the development of bash_error_lib, i missed an tool to create an CHANGELOG.md for my project. On **GitHub** i found the repo from [@lob](../../lob).
